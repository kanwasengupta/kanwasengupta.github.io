                    From Glacier National Park, we flew to Seattle to meet a few friends. We had only a day to explore and it was a tough choice 
                    between Rainier and Olympic National Parks. We ultimately chose Olympic for its diverse ecosystems and geological features.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    Olympic National Park is a geological wonderland that showcases the complex tectonic history of the Pacific Northwest. 
                    The park sits on the Olympic Peninsula, which is composed of accreted oceanic terranes that were scraped off the oceanic plate 
                    and added to the North American continent over millions of years.

                    What struck me most was the incredible diversity of rock types and ages within a relatively small area. From Paleozoic to Mesozoic 
                    marine sedimentary rocks to Miocene basalts, the park tells a story of oceanic crust formation, subduction, and accretion.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The Hoh Rainforest was absolutely magical. The combination of high precipitation, mild temperatures, and the underlying geology 
                    creates perfect conditions for this unique ecosystem. The thick soil development over the weathered marine sedimentary rocks 
                    provides excellent drainage and nutrient availability for the massive Sitka spruces and western hemlocks.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The coastal section of the park showcases spectacular examples of marine erosion and deposition. The sea stacks and arches 
                    are carved from resistant Miocene basalts and marine sedimentary rocks. The wave-cut platforms expose beautiful cross-sections 
                    of the geological formations, providing excellent opportunities to study the structural relationships between different rock units.

                    Our final stop was the Great Smoky Mountains, which provided a fascinating contrast to the young, tectonically active geology 
                    of the western parks. Here, we're looking at some of the oldest rocks in North America - Precambrian basement rocks that 
                    have been through multiple orogenic events.

                    The Smokies are part of the Appalachian Mountain system, formed during the assembly of the supercontinent Pangaea. 
                    The complex thrust faulting and folding visible throughout the park tells the story of continental collision and the 
                    closure of the ancient Iapetus Ocean.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This trip provided excellent field experience that directly relates to my research on metamorphic processes. 
                    Seeing the regional metamorphic rocks of the Appalachians helped me better understand the large-scale processes 
                    that I study in the laboratory. The contrast between contact and regional metamorphism was particularly enlightening.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    The diverse geological settings also highlighted the importance of tectonic context in understanding metamorphic processes. 
                    From the accretionary complex of Olympic to the continental collision zone of the Appalachians, each setting produces 
                    distinct metamorphic signatures that tell unique stories about Earth's dynamic history.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    This summer of national parks was not just a vacation, but an incredible field geology experience that has enriched 
                    my understanding of North American geology. From the young, active margins of the west to the ancient, stable craton 
                    of the east, each park offered unique insights into the processes that have shaped our continent.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                    As a geologist, there's nothing quite like seeing these processes written in stone across such spectacular landscapes. 
                    These experiences continue to inspire my research and remind me why I fell in love with geology in the first place.
