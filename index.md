![me during fieldwork in Canada](/assets/dp.jpg)

I am a Phd Student in Geology at the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Florida State University. My interest lies primarily in the domain of Metamorphic Petrology with focus on linking the solid earth and tectonics to past climate and Planetary habitability.I am a memeber of the Stewart Lab at EOAS (which we internally call the Stewart littles ;P)

 Currently trying to build the website  so bear with me for some time
