## Southeastern GSA 2025

Southeastern GSA is a premier regional conference for earth science students in the Southeastern part of USA. This year it has held at Harrisonburg at the Hotel Madison at James Madison University.
A bunch of students, both graduate and undergraduates set off very early from tallahassee ( before 6 AM) for Harrisonburg. It was a long journey of 15+ hours but we it was a fun and a scenic one especially in northern NC and VA.

Being a smaller conference there were a lot of undergrads, and very localised research. 

In most conference there is a dearth of sessions focusing on petrology and deformation. So this year we convened a session focusing on the deformation and metamorphism of orogens especially SOuther Appalachians.
Our session had a good mix of early career researchers and seasoned researches. Read more in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7309198409939214336/" title="LinkedIn Post">LinkedIn Post here.</a>

I had a lot of fun convening a session. Got to see and discuss some exciting new science. Looking forward to similar future opportunities.
