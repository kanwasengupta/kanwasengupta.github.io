## A summer of Travel

I am horribly late at updating, but this summer I embarked on a number of trip. The first part involved a visit to the slot canyons of North Arizona, the Grand Canyon and then to Glacier National Park followed by a day trip to the beautiful olympic National Park

Loved every bit of it. I was awestruck by the vastness of the grand canyon and the beauty of the slot canyons and the horseshoe bend as well.

After spending a few days in Arizona, we flew to Missoula to visit the Glaicer Natinal Park. The crown of continental USA was majestic indeed. Over four days did three 10 mile+ hikes- The Highline trail from Logan pass, Grinell glacier and the Iceberg lake trail.
The first was really taxing as the way down via the loop really sucked every ounce of stamina from us. The next two were longer but were much more emjoyable. We were the last ones at Grinell glacier and constantly had wildlife encounters while coming back. The Iceberg lake was great and couldnt resist taking a dip in the icecold water.

Even though it was really hot, the weather became a bit better on our last morning. While driving down the much famed Going to the sun road, was able to take in the essence of the NP at logan pass.

It was indeed a much needed break from the brutal summer back home in Florida. Will be back with the second park involving Olympic NP while returning and then a quick trip to the Smokey Mountains National Park in August.
