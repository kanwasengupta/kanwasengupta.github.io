## AGU 2024
We had a full house from Stewart Lab with Lindsi and Zhenhao having oral presentation and Sayantan and me having poster presentation.
I had a nice time interacting with researchers about my poster on mass transfer and carbon loss during contact metamorphism

We had a laboratory group lunch at the canteen of the National Museum of the American Indian. I tried the delicious Fry bread and Bison chilli.
