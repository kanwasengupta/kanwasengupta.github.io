## EPMA
UF
EPMA or Electron Micro Probe Analyzer is used to obtain micro scale quanititative data. I went to Nanoscale Research facility (NRF) at University of Florida to get microscopic composition data of my rocks from the Grenville Orogeny.

I was there for four days where two days I was trained by NRF staff and tried hands on to analyze my samples for the next two days. Even though it took some time and effort to run the samples, it was a fulfilling experience and I will definitely be back with more of my samples.
