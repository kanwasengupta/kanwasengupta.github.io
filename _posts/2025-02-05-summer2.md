## A summer of Travel- II

From Glacier national park, we flew to Seattle to meet a few friends. We had only a day to explore and it was a tough choice between Rainier and Olympic national parks. Considering that Rainier needed timed entry permits, we decided to go to Olympic National PArk.

It was a good decision indeed, because olympic became one of my favorite nation park because of its rich variety.

Saw the snow clad olympic national mountains, the rainforests and the Pacific Coast in a day.

After that classes started and needed a much needed break. So a group of us went to Smoky Mountain National Park on the Labor day Weekend.
Even though I have been to Smokies before but it was the first time I was staying in Gatlinburg. Saw black bears right on the porch of our cabin, hiked a couple of hikes and had a good time with friend.
