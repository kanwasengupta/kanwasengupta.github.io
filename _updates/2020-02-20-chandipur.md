## Sedimentological and Paleobiological field at Chandipur shore, February 2020

For our third year field work, we students of UG-III, Geological Sciences went to Chandipur sea shore to study sedimentological and biology-sediment interactions.
Sedimentological investigaions involved studying various processes in the tidal flat-swamp-bar facies. This included taking measurements of ripples, studying trenches.
Biology-sediment interactions involved studying dominant bivalve and gastropod species to understand ontogeny and taphonomy of organisms. Unnderstanding bioturbation from trenches, preference of type of gastropod shell for hermit crabs and relating sediment type to organisms

Each group of students were givent two special topics in each discipline. Ours involved 1. Studying mudballs in the bar area and understanding paleo high energy beach conditions and 2. Studying prey predator interactions in the different facies. This involved collecting 1200+ bored and unbored shells from different environements and correlating them to size, location and species.
