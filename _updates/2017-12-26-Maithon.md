Maithon field trip was my first foray into the world of Geological Field work. We were led by Prof Supriyo Mondal and Prof Susanta Chaudhuri and the field work included elements of basic field mapping, using clino and brunton compass, meausring strike dips, general petrologic and structural analysis of the area.
The Maithon area is enigmatic as it has older metamorphic rocks, intruded by younger igneous rocks, as well as sedimentary rocks.

Our field work involved a few days of getting accustomed to using field instruments, reading topo maps and taking structural measurements. Following that we were divided into groups and were responsible for making maps and collecting structural and petrologic data.

Looking back, I am glad for such a good foundational background in field geology which helped me develop a penchant for integrating fieldwork into my own research
